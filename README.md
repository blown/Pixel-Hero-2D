<h1> Pixel-Hero-2D </h1> 
<h3>Description: Pixel hero 2D is an exciting platform video game that immerses you in a vibrant world full of challenges and dangers. In this game, you take on the role of a fearless hero equipped with unique abilities that allow him to take on enemies and overcome obstacles.
From the moment you start playing, you find yourself immersed in a world full of color and life, with levels carefully designed by me as part of the Unity course I'm studying. The character has the ability to jump across platforms, crouch to avoid dangers, and fire bombs to clear a path through obstacles blocking your progress.
But that's not all, you are also armed with a bow and arrows to face the enemies that lurk around every corner! With skill and precision, you can defeat these adversaries as you make your way through the game's various levels.
While exploring the levels, I added a variety of items to collect. From static coins to spinning coins that challenge your skill, each collection brings you closer to victory. In addition, you will discover hearts scattered along the way that, along with coins, give you different abilities to face the most difficult challenges.
A highlight of the game, which I find very attractive, is the item counter, which allows you to keep track of all the coins and hearts you have collected. This adds an element of strategy, as it motivates you to explore every corner of the levels in search of every hidden object.
As the first platform game I have made, its gameplay is addictive, I can make it grow even more, the graphics used are colorful and the challenges are exciting, "Pixel Hero 2D" is a prototype that has given me a lot of knowledge in new mechanics and more knowledge to when programming certain details of the game.
